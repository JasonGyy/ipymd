`Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/>`__ is recommended to create a
Python environment within which to use ipymd:

::

    conda create -n ipymd -c cjs14 ipymd
    source activate ipymd
    ipython notebook

Currently the conda package is only available for OSX. For other operating systems, see the conda build file for guidance on package dependancies: https://github.com/chrisjsewell/ipymd/blob/master/conda_recipe/meta.yaml

A full specification of a working environment is also listed at: https://github.com/chrisjsewell/ipymd/blob/master/working_dependencies_list_osx.txt
